# Sorting
1. Use class Sort.java provided in class, the dual-pivot Quicksort of Java 8 (Arrays.sort), and RadixSort.java provided in class.
2. Do the following for Mergesort, Quicksort, Heapsort and dual-pivot Quicksort:
a. Create 100,000 random keys (of type long) and sort them. Repeat this 100 times.
b. Compute the average CPU time taken to sort the keys for the four methods.
c. Comment on the results and compare them to the average-case complexities discussed in class.
3. Do the following for the four sorting methods of #2, and for Radix sort:
a. Create 100,000 random strings of length 4 and sort them using the five sorting methods.
b. Repeat (a) 10 times and compute the average CPU time that takes to sort the keys for the five methods.
c. Repeat (a) and (b) with strings of length 6, 8, 10.
d. Create a table with the results and compare the times with the average-case and worst-case complexities as studied in class.
